                    <img src="qw.png" alt="Instagram followers" class="article-image">
                    <p style="color:black;font-size:22px;font-family:arial;" class="article-info">July 23, 2019 | 3 comments</p><br>
                    <p style="color:black;font-size:22px;font-family:arial;" class="article-body">There are a lot of people who don’t realize that there is a big difference between high-quality followers and bots. No, the only difference is not in the quality of the followers either. There are many ways you can differentiate bought followers on Instagram. If you learn how to do this properly, you’ll be able to successfully grow your Instagram account.  <br><br>Low-quality followers and bots: <br><br>
When checking the quality of bought followers, the first thing to do is check out their profiles. Low-quality followers usually have sloppy profiles that have the following traits:
Randomly generated account name 
<ul style="margin-left:50px;color:black;font-size: 22px;font-family: arial;">
  <li>Randomly generated account name</li>
  <li>Empty bios or bios with suspicious-looking links</li>
  <li>No profiles pictures or random images pulled from the Internet</li>
  <li>Poor following-to-followers ratio</li>
  <li>No posts or random posts with low engagement</li>
</ul><br>
<p style="color:black;font-size:24px;font-family:arial">
These are the first clues to look for in a bought follower. You want followers whose accounts are vibrant and active.

If the followers you have bought look something like this, you have definitely purchased low-quality followers.</p>

</p><br>
<h6 style="color:black;font-family: arial; font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold;">Low retention rate</h6><br>
                    <p style="color:black;font-size:22px;font-family:arial;" style="text-align: justify;">The main thing to know about low-quality followers is their incredibly unstable retention rate. Given that they are fake/bot followers, they tend to drop very soon after they start following you, so you should expect a drop of followers very soon after you purchase them.

When you buy followers from a low-quality provider, a few days down the line, you might find that they’ve all disappeared. Instagram’s Terms of Service prohibits the operation of fake accounts. That’s why Instagram’s algorithm is always on the hunt to find fake accounts and kick them off the platform. If the algorithm finds low-quality accounts, it is most likely going to take them down.</p><br>

<h6 style="color:black;font-family: arial; font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold;">Risking your reputation</h6><br>
                    <p style="color:black;font-size:22px;font-family:arial;" style="text-align: justify;">Not only are low-quality followers a waste of money, but they’re also a risk to your reputation. Buying followers should, in essence, boost your social proof and impress your real followers. Are your followers going to be impressed if they see a bunch of your new followers that are just fake accounts? No, they won’t be! If they find out you bought fake followers they will lose respect for you, and could unfollow you.<br><br>

If you suddenly experience a major drop in followers, or your follower list is full of shady-looking spam accounts, your real followers could discover that you have bought followers, and they may judge you for it. Or not, everyone has bad accounts on their profile… Everyone!
<br><br>
Do you think every single one of those 5.7 million followers is a good Christian? I wouldn’t bet on it as even the Pope can’t control who follows him on Instagram.<br><br>

The whole point of buying followers is to boost your stature on the platform. Why would you want to put your credibility at stake by buying low-quality followers?</p><br><br>

<h6 style="color:black;font-family: arial; font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold;">How to recognize high-quality followers</h6><br>
<p style="color:black;font-size:22px;font-family:arial;">Compared to low-quality followers, high-quality differ from low-quality followers in many ways:<br><br>
  <ul style="margin-left:50px;color:black;font-family: arial; font-size: 22px;"> 
<li>Full and complete profiles</li>
<li>Nicely written biographies</li>
<li>Real-looking profile pictures</li>
<li>Their followers-to-following ratio is even</li>
<li>They engage with people in a meaningful way</li>
</ul> <br>
<p style="color:black;font-size:22px;font-family: arial; ">
These are the sorts of accounts you want following you. They will help strengthen your social proof and boost your organic growth.
This is what a real and active follower on Instagram looks like. You should know that in order to get high-quality followers, you need to find high-quality providers. Given that there are thousands of providers out there, finding a decent one is tough. Read our reviews of the top Instagram follower providers and make a well-informed decision regarding your follower needs. </p></p><br><br>
<h6 style="color:black;font-family: arial; font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold;">High retention rate</h6><br>
<p style="color:black;font-size:22px;font-family: arial; ">High-quality followers also have higher retention rates. Once you buy high-quality followers, you can feel confident that they’ll stick around because they aren’t easily detect by the Instagram algorithm 

A true sign that a provider offers high-quality followers is that they have survived Instagram’s purges of fake accounts in the past. For example, both AudienceGain and Real Media Promotion survived the Instagram purges and are recognized as some of the top follower-providers in the industry.</p><br>
<h6 style="color:black;font-family: arial; font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold;">The benefits of buying high-quality followers</h6><br>
<p style="color:black;font-size:22px;font-family: arial; ">High-quality followers are the only sensible choice when it comes to buying Instagram followers. There are many reasons why, but I’ll stick to the main ones:<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Social proof: </span> Basically, the more followers you have, the bigger your social credibility is. As your following increases, so will your authority in your particular niche. Remember, this only applies to quality followers.<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Organic growth: </span> When people see that you have an impressive following, they’ll be more likely to follow you. Having a lot of followers increases your chances of attracting new ones. It’s all about the effect of social proof.<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Better engagement: </span> Stronger social proof means more engagement. As your real followers are increasingly impressed by your growing account they’ll be more likely to take an interest in your content and engage with you.<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Enhanced visibility: </span> Buying high-quality followers will also impact your visibility. As your organic growth increases, so will your visibility; as the Instagram algorithm favors growing accounts and promotes their content.
  There isn’t any doubt about what type of followers you need to purchase. It’s all about making the smart choice. The smart choice, when it comes to buying Instagram followers, is to always go with high-quality. Buying high-quality followers offers you a good return on investment, increases the rate of your organic growth, and strengthens your social proof.<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Always go for quality: </span> If you’re serious about growing your Instagram account, you need to buy high-quality Instagram followers. Despite the fact that you’ll probably have to pay more, it’s better to invest in followers that will actually make a difference in the growth of your Instagram account.</p><br>
